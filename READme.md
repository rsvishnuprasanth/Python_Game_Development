# 🚀 Space Maze Game: Navigate the Cosmic Labyrinth 🪐  

## 🌟 Overview  
**Space Maze Game** is a **Python-based mini-game** built using the **Turtle graphics library**.  
Your mission? Navigate your **rocket** through a maze of stars to rescue the **spaceman** stranded in space!  
The game combines creativity, logic, and fun visuals — a great beginner-friendly project demonstrating event handling, movement control, and collision detection in Python.
